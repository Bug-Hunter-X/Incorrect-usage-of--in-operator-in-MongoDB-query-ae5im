# Incorrect Usage of MongoDB's $in Operator

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries, specifically when dealing with single-element arrays.

## Problem

The `$in` operator is designed to check if a field's value exists within a given array. However, using it with a single-element array is inefficient and can lead to unexpected behavior.  The following code snippet illustrates this:

```javascript
const query = { /* some query */ };

// Incorrect usage of $in operator with a single element array
db.collection.find({ field: { $in: [value] } });
```

This query will work, but is not optimal.  A simpler and more efficient query would use a direct comparison.

## Solution

The correct approach is to use a simple equality check instead of `$in` when dealing with a single value:

```javascript
db.collection.find({ field: value });
```

This method is more efficient because MongoDB's query optimizer is better able to utilize indexes in this scenario.
